# Async Question Processing Test

## Implementation Summary

✅ **Individual Question Processing**: Modified the API to process each question separately instead of batching them all together.

✅ **Async Execution**: Using `Promise.all()` to process all questions in parallel, significantly improving performance.

✅ **Better Error Handling**: Each question is processed independently, so if one fails, the others continue processing.

✅ **Progress Tracking**: Added status updates in the frontend to show processing progress.

✅ **RTL Language Support**: Maintained full RTL support for Hebrew, Arabic, and other right-to-left languages.

## Key Changes Made

### Backend (`app/api/solve-test/route.ts`)
1. **New Function**: `solveQuestionsIndividually()` - processes each question separately
2. **Parallel Processing**: Uses `Promise.all()` for async execution
3. **Individual Prompts**: Each question gets its own optimized prompt
4. **Better Error Recovery**: Failed questions don't stop the entire process

### Frontend (`components/TestSolverApp.tsx`)
1. **Processing Status**: Shows real-time status updates during processing
2. **Better UX**: Visual feedback for each processing stage
3. **Error Handling**: Improved error messages and recovery

## Performance Improvements

- **Before**: Sequential processing of all questions together
- **After**: Parallel processing of individual questions
- **Result**: Significantly faster processing time, especially for multi-question tests

## How It Works

1. **Upload**: User uploads test image/PDF
2. **Extraction**: AI extracts individual questions
3. **Parallel Solving**: Each question is solved simultaneously using async processing
4. **Results**: All answers returned with RTL support

## Testing

The server is running on http://localhost:3002. Upload a test with multiple questions to see the async processing in action!

### Expected Behavior:
- Status updates showing: "Extracting questions..." → "Processing individual questions asynchronously..." → "Successfully solved X questions!"
- Faster overall processing time
- Hebrew/Arabic text displayed correctly with proper RTL alignment
- Individual question failures don't affect other questions
